# Help appreciated

- I am writing open source software which everybody can use for free.  
- I am writing books everybody can download for free as PDF.  
- I am giving tantric massage workshops for free.  
- I am producing videos on youtube which are also for free.

If you feel that you like to help me to keep on doing that, I am accepting donations and any kind of help. 

You can help in many ways. You can find my videos on Youtube here 
[https://www.youtube.com/user/RIAMSSoftware](https://www.youtube.com/user/RIAMSSoftware)   
and if you like them, then please **like** them and abo my channel:

You can find the source code of my software here  
[https://github.com/Artanidos](https://github.com/Artanidos)   
and you might use it and want me to improve it. Just text me and I will see what I can do.  

You can also find my products here at CrowdWare:
[https://crowdware.github.io/web](https://crowdware.github.io/web)

You can find my books here  
[https://artananda.github.io/web/book.html](https://artananda.github.io/web/book.html)  
and you might also buy them on Amazon. On Amazon you can get a kindle version of my books and if you bought it and you liked it, you can leave a recession and give the books a good rating. If you do not like one of my books, text me with your ideas. Maybe I will edit the book, so that you and the following readers can enjoy it even more.

You can also find me on patreon  
[https://www.patreon.com/artananda](https://www.patreon.com/artananda)  
and become a patron. This would be awesome ;-)

If you have questions do not hesitate to contact me at [artanidos@gmail.com](mailto:artanidos@gmail.com).  
I will be happy to help you.  
And I will also appreciate some feedback from you.  
Sometime a "thank you" or "awesome work" is more worth than money.
