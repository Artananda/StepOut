# Foreword  

First of all, this is a NO-BUDGET-Project. Please excuse my English. I did not find an editor and English is not my mother tongue, so there might be a few mistakes and my grammar might not be the best.  

If you don't like to read books with failures, then it's might not be for you. Give it to someone else instead of complaining. Complaining does not help you and it does not help me.

But if you find this book kind of valuable, then I invite you to create a recession at Amazon and leave a few stars for the rating, that helps other people to find my book and it helps me to survive and wright more book.

I went to almost every situation, I am writing here in this book, on my own. Some stories are from someone else, but if I don't mention the name of someone else, then I was going through this personally.  

By the way...all names in this book are just fiction, to not to blame someone of these nice people who have told me their stories.
