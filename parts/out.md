# How to **Step Out**

A guideline how you can step out of this system.
This guideline is based on my own experience and will be enriched with true stories from people I met on my way or people who wrote me believable stories.

## Why
Why do we step out at all?
You know...it began with these kings crusaders. They owned the land and make everybody else their slaves. It did not really looked like slavery, but who gave the land to the kings? Why should everybody else give a cent to the kings?  
They have stolen the land and have protected what they steel with their army.  
Maybe you might think now, "but the land belong to their parent and the get it from the parents". Yes that's right, but where did the parents get it from?  
If there is property, somebody has stolen it from us, from the mankind.  
You can see it in America and in the so called western. These people has stolen the land from the indigenous people who lived there before. Even the indigenous people did not own the land, they just used it. Which is the normal way, but after inventing agriculture we start to create properties. We don't wanted to let other people eat our fruits, because we have invested time to grow them. So we build fences around the land and declare it as our land now. This is also the time where humans become slaves and this is also true for the women who lived with one of these farmers. The farmer wanted to be sure that when he feeds the children of his wife, that he only feeds his own children and not the children of someone else. So we invented monogamy.  
If you have ever lived long enough together with only one partner, then you might know that she tries to control you with her sexuality.  
And also the workers for the farmers where paid and could live at the farmers houses, but they where not free. If they quit their job, they also loose their homes.  
This was the beginning of the slavery which we can see also today, even if it's more hidden.  
You might feel this.  
Do you know that your government does not want you to use land to grow food?  
Do you know that your government does not want you to build your own house?
Your government has occupied all the land. Your land, our land. And they do not give us something in return. Of course their are some countries who are paying social money, but they only pay that, after you paid something in. So the other people are paying for you, not the government. But they are asking for taxes. The are not only asking they are pressing it out of you.  

I compare it with my current style of living. I do not pay rent for a house. I do not pay for insurances. I only pay for food and sometimes for gas. I am playing music in the streets only 3 times a week for 2 hours. So I work so to say only 6 hours a week. And I feel that I have got everything I need.  
Why do you still work 40 hours a week? What is you goal to achieve and why are you doing a work you don't love at all.  

I will tell you. They tell you that you should have a big house, a big car and fine clothes and so on and so forth. They are keeping you in fear. They tell you, that if you are quitting your job, you will loose all of this and will become a beggar.  
In fact you have a house which is empty the whole day, because you are working. You have got a car to drive to your job and you are wearing these fine clothes so that the people accept you doing your job.  
You don't need this at all.

## Fears
The main reason why so many people are still in the system is fear. The people, and maybe it's also true for you, are scared to quit what they are doing, because the system is scaring them.  

When I say quit, I mean, liberate yourself from being a slave to the society.  
If you fear to loose your job you will be a good worker. You are coming on time every day. You do your job the best you can and you produce money for the boss. It's all about creating much money for your boss.

I don't wanne blame your boss. He or she is also just a victim of our society. 

When you grow up everybody is telling you something like the following:
"You have to learn something."  
"You have to become someone."  
"You should study something."  
"You should go to work."  
"If you are hungry, then you have to work, to get money and to buy food."  
"You have to become rich to survive."  

All these good advises are coming from people who still belief in this system. They don't know it better, so they are not able to give you a better advice.  
Anf If people wake up and are going to tell you te truth, they would embarrass themselves, because they have been fallen into this trap for years.

There are all these companies who know about fear and they use this fear to make you scared to make more money. I don't wanne blame them, I already told you, they don't know it better.  
There is for example the insurances. They telling you that you might have an accident and therefore you need an insurance. And if you have got an insurance no accidents will happen, because you don't fear them any more.  

What I want to say is...if you fear something, your are manifesting it. It will come to your life. This is the law of attraction. If you want something very bad or you fear something, you have got a focus on that. And when you have got a focus on something, then it will come to your life.  

## System  

What is the so called system you may ask?
The system is called capitalism or communism. Everybody in the system has to work to make money. Money we need to pay the rent for our house or flat and we need money to buy food etc.
In countries where the children are not able to go to school and to go to university they have to work. I am talking about hard work. I am talking about children at the age of 8 years or even younger that are working for these companies that are abusing these little beings with very low salaries.  

If your parents where not able to pay for your school and your university you have no good chances to get a good, well payed job at all. You are to stay poor for the rest of your life.
Even if you have got a good job in the town, you are not able to pay a flat or a house there, so you have to travel many kilometres each day.  
The bad thing about the system is, that only a few people which are already rich will get more and more money from the poor people, while the poor people get poorer and poorer.  
Also the governments have to go into more debts each year without the chance to pay back the debts at all.  
So they have to pay more interest rates every year and the people of these countries have to pay more and more taxes.  

I have had a company in Germany and I had to pay about 45 percent income taxes. In Denmark the people have to pay even more. 51 percent income taxes plus additional 25 percent value added taxes. So if you work in Denmark you are only getting 25 percent of your salary to live from. 
That is slavery!

While in Switzerland I did the same job as in Germany and I only had to pay 12 percent income taxes and only 8 percent value added taxes, which is 20 percent combined. Also too high, but compared to Denmark acceptable.

So what is the government in Switzerland doing better than the government in Denmark?
In Switzerland they have got direct democracy. So the people decide how much taxes to pay and what to spent taxes for.
In Denmark and Germany it is poor **slavery**.  
Do you know that unemployed people in Germany could have been sanctioned not accepting a job or not attending to an interview or something like this? These poor people have to take every job they offer them. So the people have to work in the defense industry otherwise they will not get any money from the government even if they were paying taxes for many many years. They will loose their homes, because they are not able to pay the rent any more and they will literally die, because they are not able to buy food any more.  
Luckily a good friend of mine from Berlin was fighting for our human rights for many years, but still they are able to cut this money for 30 percent. This is still against the human rights. So without the right to live a good life I call it **slavery**.  
I personally have also been cutted to 100 percent. I am not getting any money from the so called jobcenter any more, because I am now in Portugal and was not following the invitations of the jobcenter. I have not told them, that I am in Portugal, so they don't know, but still not paying me any more. So they still ignoring my human rights. I am in a good situation. I can help myself. But all the other sheeples are not able to. So the governments is not only risking their lives, they are also risking the other peoples life, because when someone is not getting any money he or she might get into crime.  

The idea that people should pay tithes (10 percent of the annual produce of land or labour) to support their minister and church was established in the 8th century.  

Even 10 percent was to much for the people.  

So what has happened?  
Yeah, it's the debts of the governments. They for example were building these really large buildings to govern the people. They needed the military to defend the country and in case of the USA they spend a huge amount of taxes to fight against countries which have oil to control these countries.  

The governments are also imprison us at home, because of this corona virus. There are many scientist already saying that this virus exists since a few years, and that you will find it in most of us, but it is not breaking out. Only very young and very old people are dying from this. But the truth is, they will die anyways because of other diseases. So they might use this pandemy to vaccinate all of us based on a new law. In Denmark they already have created this law. 
And who is the winner? 
Big pharma.
Also it could be possible that they use this pandemy to forbid cash money. And then, they are able to control us. They know where we are, even if we do not use smartphoes any more, and they know, what we are buying, in which bordell we are going, how much alcohol we drink and so on and so forth.

These are only a few examples...there is more wrong with these governments, and we have to stop them NOW!

Maybe I am wrong. Hopefully. Lets manifest that everything is for a good reason <3  

This system drains our planet that we are not able to survive that long. There is no **plan**et **B**.  

We have to get rid of these so called elite who are controlling our governments.  

Do you know that most of our laws are just there to make these people more rich?  

Why is it forbidden to collect rain water in the USA? Why do you have to pay electricity in Spain even if you produce it on your own with solar panels? Why does Madrid not accept, that Catalunia will be separarted from Spain? 
Why do they kill inventors like Tesla?

You just have to follow the track of the money!

## Solutions
![freedom](../images/freedom.png "freedom")
I see some solutions to step out and how to ignore the system. It it easy if you know how to, but it might be a challenge for some people.  

The easy way is to not give any might to the governments and the big companies. If we don't give them their might, then they are powerless. I mean paying taxes. If we would stop paying taxes the politician will look for another job. I do not mean to just stop to pay, I mean, do not work that much any more and you will earn less and then you do not have to pay much taxes.
If we don't take out credits any more, then the banksters will get bankrupt. The word bankrupt comes from bank and disruption.  
If we do not use their money any more they will loose their power. If we do not buy their products then the companies will also get bankrupt.

So we don't have to fight against the system. We just not feed it any more!  

Just easy.  

To be honest this is hard, because we have to rethink how to live, where to live what to eat.  

This book will give you some hints.  

You don't have to live that extreme like me.  
I was once working for the banksters in Zürich getting a 5 digit amount each month and now, after two burnouts I am living without any income from busking in the streets and food saving.   And no, I don't have savings to live from.  
But I am free.  
I am waking up without the need of an alarm clock.  
They birds are waking me up, or at the very moment the waves are waking me up, when they break at the shore. I am in Nazare, Portugal, right now. Here you can see the biggest waves in the whole world. 20 meters and higher.   
This is freedom...to be somewhere you want to be.  
Not in an office nor a factory.
